The supplied example is a minimal game, with only the bare basics in place. 
The sources for the CHIP8/SuperChip version, and the MegaChip8 version are both supplied.

For easy building (build.bat and buildmega.bat), install the package in a subdirectory of the MegaChip emulator (e.g. <emulatorpath>\megachip8dev).


Enjoy!
